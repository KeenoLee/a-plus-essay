## Good points:  
1. Reasonable / meanful naming  
2. Double checking data in backend  
3. Strong type sences with typescript  

## Improve section    
1. may use react hook form for form uploading  
2. In frontend, components can be located into different folder instead of single folder only.  
3. Do not let you single components more than ~600-900 lines of code, unless a reason to do like this, otherwish DONT. (Register.tsx) 
4. Try to make components more fragments
5. Separacted routers into different folders (e.g. hello -> helloControllers, helloServices, helloRoute) 

## minor issues / style:  
1. suggest to have more spacing between code and lines  
2. May add {} in one line if case, or just use <conditions> && someFunction(); case  

## Extra:  
1. Form validations can use https://github.com/jquense/yup
